## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Recommended)

**Quick Deploy (Windows):**
```bash
# Run the deployment script
.\deploy.bat
```

**What it does:**
1. Switches to `gh-pages` branch
2. Copies build files (favicon.png, index.html, src.apk)
3. Commits and pushes to GitHub
4. Returns to main branch

**After deployment:**
- Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (if not already enabled)
- Settings → Pages → Source: `gh-pages` branch → Save
- Your game will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/PokemonBlueGacha/`
- Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Test Locally First

**Run local test server:**
```bash
pygbag --build src/main.py
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Note: Audio may not work in local testing (requires user interaction on actual domain)

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

If the script doesn't work:
1. `git checkout gh-pages` (or `git checkout -b gh-pages`)
2. Copy `src/build/web/*` to repository root
3. `git add favicon.png index.html src.apk`
4. `git commit -m "Deploy web build"`
5. `git push -u origin gh-pages`
6. `git checkout main`
