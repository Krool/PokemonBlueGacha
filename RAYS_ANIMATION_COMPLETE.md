# Rays Animation Effect Complete

## Summary
Added a dynamic rays background effect to the gacha animation that scales and colorizes based on Pokemon rarity, creating more visual excitement during pulls.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Added Rays Image to Config
**Location**: `src/config.py`

Added the rays image path constant:
```python
RAYS_PATH = "Assets/Sprites/Main/rays.png"
```

### 2. Updated Resource Manager
**Location**: `src/managers/resource_manager.py`

Modified `load_ui_images()` to load the rays effect:
- Added `rays_path` parameter
- Loads and stores rays image as `self.rays`
- Updated method signature and documentation

### 3. Updated Loading State
**Location**: `src/states/loading_state.py`

- Added `RAYS_PATH` to imports
- Passed `RAYS_PATH` to `load_ui_images()` call

### 4. Implemented Rays Effect in Animation
**Location**: `src/states/gacha_animation_state.py`

Added new `_render_rays_effect()` method with the following features:

#### Rarity-Based Scaling
The rays get progressively larger for rarer Pokemon:
- **Common**: 1.0x scale (800px base)
- **Uncommon**: 1.1x scale (880px)
- **Rare**: 1.3x scale (1040px)
- **Epic**: 1.5x scale (1200px)
- **Legendary**: 1.8x scale (1440px)

#### Rarity-Based Colorization
The rays are tinted with the rarity color at varying intensities:
- **Common**: 30 alpha (subtle white tint)
- **Uncommon**: 50 alpha (light green tint)
- **Rare**: 80 alpha (noticeable blue tint)
- **Epic**: 120 alpha (strong purple tint)
- **Legendary**: 180 alpha (intense orange tint)

#### Animation Effects
1. **Spinning**: Rays rotate continuously based on animation duration
2. **Fade In**: Rays fade in over the first 30% of the animation
3. **Positioning**: Centered behind the Pokemon sprite

#### Integration
- Rays render **before** the Pokemon sprite (background layer)
- Only applies to single pulls (where the focus is on one Pokemon)
- Automatically uses the rarity color from the rarity data

## Technical Details

### Color Overlay Method
Uses `pygame.BLEND_RGBA_MULT` to apply the rarity color as a multiplicative tint:
```python
color_overlay = pygame.Surface(colorized_rays.get_size(), pygame.SRCALPHA)
color_overlay.fill((*rarity_color, alpha))
colorized_rays.blit(color_overlay, (0, 0), special_flags=pygame.BLEND_RGBA_MULT)
```

### Rotation Calculation
Rotates one full circle over the duration of the animation:
```python
rotation_speed = 360 / self.duration
angle = (self.animation_time * rotation_speed) % 360
rotated_rays = pygame.transform.rotate(colorized_rays, angle)
```

### Performance Considerations
- Image scaling is done once per frame
- Rotation is applied to the already-scaled and colorized image
- Alpha blending is used efficiently with pygame's built-in blend modes

## Visual Hierarchy

The rendering order for single pulls is now:
1. **Black background** (fills screen)
2. **Rays effect** (scaled, colorized, spinning)
3. **Pokemon sprite** (with shake, rotation, and color tint effects)
4. **Rarity text** (fades in after 50% progress)
5. **Skip hint text** (bottom of screen)

## Rarity Comparison

### Common Pull
- Small rays (800px)
- Subtle white tint
- Minimal visual impact

### Legendary Pull
- Large rays (1440px, 80% bigger)
- Intense orange glow
- Dramatic spinning effect
- Creates "epic" moment

## Files Modified
1. `src/config.py` - Added RAYS_PATH constant
2. `src/managers/resource_manager.py` - Updated load_ui_images() signature
3. `src/states/loading_state.py` - Added RAYS_PATH to imports and load call
4. `src/states/gacha_animation_state.py` - Implemented _render_rays_effect() method

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Pull different rarities**: Verify rays scale and color correctly for each
2. **Common vs Legendary**: Notice the dramatic difference in visual impact
3. **Animation flow**: Ensure rays fade in smoothly and spin continuously
4. **Performance**: Check frame rate remains smooth even with large legendary rays
5. **10-pull**: Verify rays don't interfere with 10-pull grid display

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add pulsing effect to legendary rays
- Particle effects emanating from rays
- Different ray patterns for different rarity tiers
- Sound effects synchronized with ray appearance
