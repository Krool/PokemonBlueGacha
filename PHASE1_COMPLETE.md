### Features Implemented

âœ… **Data Loading System**
- CSV loader with robust error handling
- Pokemon, Type, and Rarity data structures
- Data integrity validation
- 151 PokÃ©mon loaded successfully
- 15 types loaded successfully
- 5 rarities loaded successfully

âœ… **Save System**
- JSON-based save file
- SaveManager for file operations
- GameData class for session management
- Auto-save on quit
- Persistence between launches

âœ… **Resource Management**
- ResourceManager with image caching
- Placeholder images for missing assets
- Easy access to Pokemon sprites and type icons
- Preload system (ready for Phase 2)

âœ… **Audio Management**
- AudioManager with graceful fallback
- Music and sound effect support
- Volume controls
- Ready for Phase 2 implementation

âœ… **State System**
- Base GameState class
- StateManager for transitions
- Loading state (placeholder with progress bar)
- Inventory state (placeholder with stats)

âœ… **Main Game Loop**
- 60 FPS game loop
- Event handling
- State updates and rendering
- Clean shutdown with save

### How to Run

```bash
# From project root
python src/main.py
```

**Controls (Placeholder)**:
- Loading screen: Press any key to skip
- Inventory screen: ESC to quit
- Game saves automatically on exit

### Test Results

âœ… Application launches successfully
âœ… CSV data loads without errors
âœ… Save file created/loaded correctly
âœ… Loading screen displays with progress bar
âœ… Automatically transitions to Inventory
âœ… Inventory shows gold and owned count
âœ… Game saves on exit
âœ… Persistence works across launches

### Issues Resolved

1. âœ… Path inconsistencies fixed (CSVs in data/)
2. âœ… Import paths corrected for running from root
3. âœ… ResourceManager fully implemented
4. âœ… AudioManager stub created
5. âœ… GameData class for shared state
6. âœ… State constructors standardized
7. âœ… Robust error handling added
8. âœ… Data validation implemented

### Phase 1 Deliverables

âœ… Runnable application
âœ… CSV data loads correctly into data structures
âœ… Save system can save/load data
âœ… State system switches between states
âœ… GameData holds current session state
âœ… ResourceManager exists (sprites load in Phase 2)
âœ… Error handling for missing files
âœ… No crashes or critical bugs

## Next Steps - Phase 2

Phase 2 will focus on:
- Loading all Pokemon sprites
- Loading type icons
- Loading logo and gacha images
- Implementing audio system fully
- Testing asset loading during Loading screen

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE and STABLE!** ðŸŽ‰
