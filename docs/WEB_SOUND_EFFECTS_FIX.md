# Web Sound Effects Fix

## üêõ Issue
Background music was playing in the web view, but sound effects (roll sounds, legendary sound, etc.) were not playing.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Problems Found:

1. **File Extension Mismatch**
   - Code was looking for `.wav` files first
   - Actual files are `.mp3` in `Assets/Sounds/`
   - Sound loader tried wrong extensions first

2. **Web-Specific Loading Issue**
   - Desktop: Pre-loaded sounds into `self.sounds` dict
   - Web: Only stored paths in `self.sound_paths`, didn't pre-load
   - Line 62-65: Only loaded sounds on desktop (`if not IS_WEB`)

3. **Playback Method Issue**
   - Line 87-92: On web, tried to load Sound from path every time `play_sound()` was called
   - This caused issues with Pygbag's file handling
   - Desktop worked fine because sounds were pre-loaded

4. **No User Interaction Check**
   - Music had the user interaction check
   - Sound effects didn't check if user had interacted yet

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Sound Loading
**Changed:** Load sounds for BOTH desktop and web (removed the `if not IS_WEB` check)

```python
# OLD (only desktop)
if not IS_WEB:
    sound = pygame.mixer.Sound(path)
    sound.set_volume(self.sfx_volume)
    self.sounds[name] = sound

# NEW (both platforms)
sound = pygame.mixer.Sound(path)
sound.set_volume(self.sfx_volume)
self.sounds[name] = sound
```

**Why:** Pygbag handles loading files properly on web, so we can pre-load just like desktop.

### 2. Fixed Playback Method
**Changed:** Use pre-loaded sounds for BOTH desktop and web

```python
# OLD (web tried to load on-the-fly)
if IS_WEB:
    channel = pygame.mixer.find_channel()
    if channel:
        sound = pygame.mixer.Sound(self.sound_paths[name])  # ‚ùå Loading each time
        sound.set_volume(self.sfx_volume)
        channel.play(sound)

# NEW (both use pre-loaded)
self.sounds[name].play()  # ‚úÖ Use pre-loaded sound
```

**Why:** Simpler, more reliable, works the same on both platforms.

### 3. Added User Interaction Check
**Added:** Check if user has interacted before playing sounds (same as music)

```python
# Check if user has interacted (required for web)
if IS_WEB and not self.user_interacted:
    print(f"  ‚è∏ Sound '{name}' queued (waiting for user interaction)")
    return
```

**Why:** Browser autoplay policy requires user interaction before playing audio.

### 4. Fixed File Extensions
**Changed:** Look for `.mp3` files first (matching actual files)

```python
# OLD (wrong extension order)
sound_files = {
    'roll1': 'roll1.wav',  # ‚ùå Looking for .wav
    ...
}

# NEW (correct extensions)
sound_files = {
    'roll1': 'roll1.mp3',  # ‚úÖ Looking for .mp3
    ...
}
```

**Why:** Actual files are `.mp3`, not `.wav`.

### 5. Better Error Logging
**Added:** Traceback printing to help debug issues

```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading sound {name} from {path}: {e}")
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exc()  # Show full stack trace
```

**Why:** Better debugging information for web issues.

## üß™ Testing

### To Verify the Fix:

1. **Visit the live site**: https://krool.github.io/PokemonBlueGacha/
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Look for during loading**:
   ```
   Loading sound effects...
     ‚úì Loaded sound: roll1 from roll1.mp3
     ‚úì Loaded sound: roll2 from roll2.mp3
     ‚úì Loaded sound: roll3 from roll3.mp3
     ‚úì Loaded sound: legendary from legendary.mp3
     ‚úì Loaded sound: chaching from chaching.mp3
     ‚úì Loaded sound: gotemall from gotemall.mp3
   ‚úì Loaded 6 sound effects
   ```
4. **Interact with the game** (click or press a key)
5. **Do a pull** from any gacha machine
6. **Listen for**:
   - Roll sound (roll1, roll2, or roll3)
   - Legendary sound if you get a legendary
   - Cash register sound (chaching) for special pulls
7. **Check console** for:
   ```
   üîä Playing sound: roll1
   ```

### Expected Behavior:

| Action | Expected Sound | When |
|--------|---------------|------|
| **Pull from gacha** | Random roll sound (roll1/2/3) | During animation |
| **Get legendary** | Legendary fanfare | When legendary appears |
| **Special pull** | Cash register (chaching) | Special items |
| **Complete collection** | "Got 'em all!" sound | When collection complete |

## üìã Changes Summary

### `src/managers/audio_manager.py`

**Lines 42-71** (`load_sound` method):
- ‚úÖ Removed `if not IS_WEB` check
- ‚úÖ Load sounds for both desktop and web
- ‚úÖ Added traceback for errors

**Lines 73-99** (`play_sound` method):
- ‚úÖ Added user interaction check
- ‚úÖ Use pre-loaded sounds for both platforms
- ‚úÖ Simplified to single code path
- ‚úÖ Better error messages with available sounds list

**Lines 214-250** (`load_game_sounds` method):
- ‚úÖ Changed file extensions from `.wav` to `.mp3`
- ‚úÖ Simplified loading logic
- ‚úÖ Fallback to `.wav`/`.ogg` if `.mp3` not found

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Pygbag handles file loading** - No need for different code paths
2. **Pre-load sounds** - Works for both desktop and web
3. **User interaction required** - Browser autoplay policy applies to ALL audio
4. **Check file extensions** - Match what's actually in the Assets folder
5. **Consistent code paths** - Same logic for desktop and web when possible
