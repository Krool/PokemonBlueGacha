---

## Phase 6: Enhanced Features ✅

### Statistics & Recommendations
- **Stats Popup** (INFO button on Pokédex):
  - Total pulls across all machines
  - Pulls per machine (Red/Blue/Yellow)
  - Expected pulls to get rarest remaining Pokémon per machine
  - Expected pulls from scratch (sum of all three)
  - Optimal strategy cost (clickable to set gold)
- **Recommended Badge**: Shows which machine needs the most pulls
- **Gacha Stats Utility**: Coupon collector calculations

### Drop Rate Transparency
- **INFO button** on Gacha Buy page
- Scrollable popup showing all Pokémon and exact drop rates
- Rarity color-coded dots
- Percentage shown to 4 decimal places
- Version-specific calculations

### Audio System
- **Background Music**: 8 tracks, randomly shuffled
- **Music Changes**: On unmute and when clicking Pokédollar
- **Sound Effects**:
  - roll1-3.mp3: Random for common/uncommon/rare/epic
  - legendary.mp3: For legendary pulls
  - chaching.mp3: When legendary is pulled
  - gotemall.mp3: When collection is completed (plays once)
- **Mute Toggle**: Persists between sessions
- Volume: 50% reduction from original levels

### Pokédollar System
- Renamed from "gold" to "Pokédollar" throughout
- Pokédollar icon displayed with currency
- Clickable currency display:
  - Single click: Add 10,000
  - Hold click: Continuously add 10,000 every 0.1s
- Currency display on all relevant pages
- Dark gray background container with border

### Animation Polish
- **Rays Effect**: 
  - Scales by rarity (1.25x for Common, 2.5x for Legendary)
  - Color-tinted by rarity
  - Rotates during animation
  - Individual rays for 10-pull grid
- **Pokémon Effects**:
  - Shake offset based on rarity
  - Rotation effect
  - Color tinting
  - Staggered animation in 10-pulls

### UI/UX Improvements
- Larger count labels on Pokémon tiles (2x size)
- Larger "NEW!" badges (2x size)
- Truncated Pokémon names to prevent overflow
- Proper spacing between elements
- Machine selection memory (remembers last selected)
- Confined gacha images to screen size
