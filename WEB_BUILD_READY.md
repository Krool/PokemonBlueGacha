## 🌐 Access the Game

### Local Test Server
The game is currently running at:
```

```

**Just open that URL in your browser!**

## 🎵 Audio System Improvements

This build includes critical audio fixes:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Double Mixer Initialization** - Now properly initializes once with optimal settings
2. **Browser Autoplay Policy** - Music queues until user interaction
3. **User Interaction Detection** - First click/keypress enables audio seamlessly
4. **Web Compatibility** - 8 audio channels for concurrent sound effects

### 🎯 Expected Behavior:
- Game loads → music queues
- First click/keypress → music starts
- Sound effects work during gacha pulls
- Music continues between screens
- Smooth, professional experience

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Open **http://localhost:8000**
2. Watch it load (beautiful loading screen!)
3. Click anywhere or press any key
4. Music should start immediately
5. Click currency → Add gold
6. Open Gacha → Do a pull
7. Listen for sound effects

**If all of that works, the audio system is perfect! 🎉**
