## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Step 1: Wait 2-5 Minutes
GitHub Pages needs time to build and deploy. First deployment takes longest.

### Step 2: Visit Your Game
Open in browser: **https://Krool.github.io/PokemonBlueGacha/**

### Step 3: Check GitHub Pages Status
1. Go to: https://github.com/Krool/PokemonBlueGacha/settings/pages
2. Should say: "Your site is published at https://Krool.github.io/PokemonBlueGacha/"

### Step 4: Test Audio Fixes
1. Game loads → Check browser console (F12)
2. Expected: "Music queued (waiting for user interaction)"
3. Click anywhere on the screen
4. Expected: "User interaction detected - audio enabled"  
5. Music should start playing immediately
6. Add gold (click currency) → Do a gacha pull
7. Expected: Sound effects play (roll sounds)

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### On Load
```
✓ Audio mixer initialized
  Set up 8 audio channels for web compatibility
  Note: Audio may require user interaction to start (browser policy)
...
⏸ Music queued (waiting for user interaction): backgroundX.mp3
```

### After First Click
```
✓ User interaction detected - audio enabled
  Playing pending music: backgroundX.mp3
🎵 Playing random background music: backgroundX.mp3
```

### During Gameplay
- Music continues between screens
- Sound effects play on gacha pulls
- No stuttering or lag
- Mute/unmute works correctly
