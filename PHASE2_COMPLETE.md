# Phase 2 Complete! âœ…

## Asset Management System Implemented

### What Was Built

âœ… **Enhanced ResourceManager**
- Progress callback system for loading feedback
- Preloads all 151 PokÃ©mon sprites
- Preloads all 15 type icons
- Loads UI images (logo, gacha machine)
- Image caching for performance
- Placeholder system for missing assets

âœ… **Enhanced AudioManager**
- Loads all sound effects (roll1, roll2, roll3, legendary)
- Background music loading and playback
- Auto-detects file format (.wav, .mp3, .ogg)
- Volume controls for music and SFX
- Graceful fallback if audio unavailable

âœ… **Enhanced Loading Screen**
- Displays logo (or fallback title)
- Shows loading stages:
  1. Loading UI images...
  2. Loading PokÃ©mon sprites...
  3. Loading audio...
  4. Complete!
- Real-time progress bar (0-100%)
- Progress updates during sprite loading
- Auto-transitions to Inventory when complete
- Background music starts during loading

### Assets Loaded

- **151 PokÃ©mon Sprites**: `Assets/Sprites/Pokemon/*.png`
- **15 Type Icons**: `Assets/Sprites/Types/*.png`
- **Logo**: `Assets/logo.png`
- **Gacha Machine**: `Assets/gacha.png`
- **Sound Effects**: `Assets/Sounds/roll*.wav`, `legendary.wav`
- **Background Music**: `Assets/Sounds/background.*`

### Features

âœ… Progress tracking during asset loading
âœ… Visual feedback with progress bar
âœ… Stage-by-stage loading indication
âœ… Background music auto-starts
âœ… Smooth transition to Inventory
âœ… All assets cached in memory
âœ… Missing assets handled gracefully

### Technical Improvements

1. **Progress Callback System**
   - Real-time updates during sprite loading
   - Updates every 10 sprites to balance performance and feedback

2. **Smart Audio Loading**
   - Tries multiple audio formats
   - Handles missing audio files
   - Separate handling for music vs sound effects

3. **Optimized Loading**
   - Assets loaded once and cached
   - Placeholder images for missing files
   - No crashes if assets are missing

### How It Works

```python
Loading Screen Flow:
1. Enter state â†’ Display logo
2. Load UI images â†’ 33% progress
3. Load Pokemon sprites â†’ 33-66% progress (updates in real-time)
4. Load audio â†’ 66-100% progress
5. Start background music
6. Brief pause at 100%
7. Auto-transition to Inventory
```

## Next Phase

**Phase 3: UI Component Library**

We'll build the reusable UI components needed for all game screens:
- Button component
- Label/Text component  
- Checkbox component
- Scrollable list component
- Pokemon tile component
- Popup/modal component

These will be used to build the actual Inventory and Gacha screens.

**Phase 2 is COMPLETE!** ðŸŽ®
All assets are loading successfully!
