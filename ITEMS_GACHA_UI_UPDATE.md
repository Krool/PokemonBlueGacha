# Items Gacha UI Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Items Machine Image
**File**: `src/states/gacha_buy_state.py`

**Before**:
```python
elif self.selected_machine == "Items":
    machine_image = self.resource_manager.gacha_item_image
```

**After**:
```python
elif self.selected_machine == "Items":
    machine_image = self.resource_manager.gacha_item
```

**Why**: The correct attribute name is `gacha_item` (not `gacha_item_image`), which is loaded in `ResourceManager.load_ui_images()`.

### 2. Removed Featured Items Display
**File**: `src/states/gacha_buy_state.py`

**Before**:
- Items machine showed 3 featured high-value items (Legendary/Epic)
- Items were displayed in 80x80 boxes with icons

**After**:
- Items machine shows NO featured items
- Only the gacha machine image (`gacha_item.png`) is displayed

**Implementation**:
```python
# Draw featured Pokemon sprites (3 random for this machine)
# Don't show featured items for Items machine
if self.selected_machine != "Items" and hasattr(self, 'featured_pokemon') and self.selected_machine in self.featured_pokemon:
    # Draw featured Pokemon
    featured = self.featured_pokemon[self.selected_machine]
    # ... rest of featured Pokemon rendering code
```

**Why**: User requested to not display preview items for the Items machine, keeping the UI cleaner and more mysterious (players need to check the info popup to see what's available).

## Visual Changes

### Before:
- Items Machine displayed `gacha_item_image` (undefined → crash or placeholder)
- 3 featured items shown below the machine (e.g., Master Ball, Rare Candy, Earthquake TM)

### After:
- Items Machine displays `gacha_item.png` (proper image)
- No featured items shown
- Clean, simple UI with just the machine image and description
