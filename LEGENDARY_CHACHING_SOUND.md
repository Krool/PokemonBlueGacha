# Legendary Chaching Sound Effect

## Summary
Added the chaching sound effect to play whenever a Legendary Pokemon is pulled, creating extra audio excitement for the rarest pulls.

## Changes Completed

### 1. Added Chaching Sound to Audio Manager
**Location**: `src/managers/audio_manager.py`

Updated `load_game_sounds()` to include the chaching sound:
```python
sound_files = {
    'roll1': 'roll1.wav',
    'roll2': 'roll2.wav',
    'roll3': 'roll3.wav',
    'legendary': 'legendary.wav',
    'chaching': 'chaching.wav',  # Special sound for legendary pulls
    'background': 'background.wav'
}
```

The audio manager will automatically:
- Try loading `chaching.wav`, `chaching.mp3`, or `chaching.ogg`
- Set appropriate volume based on SFX volume settings
- Make it available for playback via `audio_manager.play_sound("chaching")`

### 2. Updated Legendary Sound Logic
**Location**: `src/states/gacha_animation_state.py`

Modified `_play_rarity_sound()` to play both sounds for legendary pulls:
```python
def _play_rarity_sound(self, rarity: str):
    """Play sound effect based on rarity"""
    if rarity == "Legendary":
        self.audio_manager.play_sound("legendary")
        # Also play chaching sound for extra excitement on legendary pulls
        self.audio_manager.play_sound("chaching")
    else:
        # Randomly pick roll1, roll2, or roll3
        roll_sfx = random.choice(["roll1", "roll2", "roll3"])
        self.audio_manager.play_sound(roll_sfx)
```

## Audio Experience

### Non-Legendary Pulls
- **Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic**: Random roll sound (roll1, roll2, or roll3)
- Creates variety while keeping pulls exciting

### Legendary Pulls
- **Legendary sound**: The dramatic "legendary" sound effect
- **Chaching sound**: Layered on top for extra impact
- Both sounds play simultaneously, creating a rich, exciting audio moment

## Technical Details

### Sound Layering
Pygame's mixer supports multiple sounds playing simultaneously:
- Both sounds are loaded as separate `pygame.mixer.Sound` objects
- Calling `play_sound()` twice plays them concurrently
- They mix together naturally without cutting each other off

### Volume Control
- Both sounds respect the SFX volume setting
- Players can adjust volume via audio manager settings
- Sounds won't be too loud since they're mixed together

### Timing
- Sounds play at the start of the animation (`enter()` method)
- Synchronized with the visual rays effect
- Creates a unified audio-visual legendary moment

## Impact on Gameplay

### Psychological Effect
- **Instant Recognition**: Players immediately know they got something special
- **Reward Feeling**: The chaching sound is associated with winning/success
- **Excitement Peak**: Combined with large spinning rays and longer animation

### Rarity Differentiation
Now each rarity tier has distinct audio feedback:
1. **Common/Uncommon/Rare/Epic**: Random roll sounds (variety)
2. **Legendary**: Legendary + chaching (special treatment)

This creates clear audio hierarchy that reinforces rarity value.

## Files Modified
1. `src/managers/audio_manager.py` - Added chaching to sound loading
2. `src/states/gacha_animation_state.py` - Updated _play_rarity_sound() for legendaries

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Pull a Legendary**: Verify both sounds play together
2. **Volume Test**: Check sounds aren't too loud when layered
3. **Multiple Legendaries**: Test 10-pull with multiple legendaries
4. **Sound Quality**: Ensure sounds complement rather than clash
5. **Skip Animation**: Verify sounds don't continue if animation is skipped

## Audio Files Used
- `Assets/Sounds/legendary.mp3` - Dramatic legendary sound
- `Assets/Sounds/chaching.mp3` - Success/reward sound
- Both files exist in the project

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Add unique sounds for Epic pulls
- Rare-specific sound effects
- Victory fanfare for completing the Pok√©dex
- Sound when getting a new Pokemon (not just legendary)
