# UI Polish Update - Complete

## Overview
This update implements several UI polish improvements requested by the user to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the Pokemon Blue Gacha prototype.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Pokemon Tile Count Label Size
**File**: `src/ui/pokemon_tile.py`
- Reduced count label font size from 28 to 21 (25% smaller)
- Count label in top-left corner of owned Pokemon tiles is now more subtle

**Code Change**:
```python
# Before: font_size=28
# After:  font_size=21
text_surface = self.font_manager.render_text(count_text, 21, (255, 255, 255), is_title=True)
```

### 2. Pokemon Name Padding
**File**: `src/ui/pokemon_tile.py`
- Added padding above Pokemon names in tiles
- Changed name position from `height - 45` to `height - 40`
- Provides better visual spacing between the sprite and the name

**Code Change**:
```python
# Before: name_y = self.rect.y + self.rect.height - 45
# After:  name_y = self.rect.y + self.rect.height - 40
```

### 3. Currency Display Background Container
**Files**: 
- `src/states/gacha_outcome_state.py`
- `src/states/gacha_buy_state.py`

**Changes**:
- Added dark gray (50, 50, 50) background container with 10px padding
- Added light gray (100, 100, 100) 2px border
- Container is clickable for adding gold (+10000)
- Background rect is stored as `self.currency_rect` for click detection

**Visual Effect**:
- Currency display now has a subtle background box that makes it stand out
- The container provides a clear clickable target area
- Consistent across both gacha buy and outcome pages

### 4. Outcome Page Button Redesign
**File**: `src/states/gacha_outcome_state.py`

**Changes**:
- Increased button height from 50 to 80 pixels (matching gacha buy page)
- Increased button width from 200 to 220 pixels
- Repositioned buttons to prevent overlap (spacing = 30px between buttons)
- Buttons now centered as a group using calculated `start_x`
- Cost is now displayed INSIDE the "PULL AGAIN" button (below text)
- Button position moved from `SCREEN_HEIGHT - 80` to `SCREEN_HEIGHT - 130`

**Button Layout**:
```
[PULL AGAIN] [GACHA] [INVENTORY]
   (cost)
```

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Button dimensions
button_width = 220    # Was 200
button_height = 80    # Was 50
button_y = SCREEN_HEIGHT - 130  # Was SCREEN_HEIGHT - 80

# Calculate total width for 3 buttons
total_button_width = button_width * 3 + button_spacing * 2
start_x = (SCREEN_WIDTH - total_button_width) // 2

# Cost displayed inside button
CurrencyDisplay.render_centered(
    self.screen,
    self.roll_same_button.rect.centerx,
    self.roll_same_button.rect.centery + 20,  # Inside button, below text
    self.roll_same_cost,
    # ...
)
```

## Visual Improvements Summary

1. **More Subtle Count Labels**: Pokemon tile counts are now 25% smaller, less visually intrusive
2. **Better Name Spacing**: Added padding above Pokemon names for cleaner look
3. **Currency Emphasis**: Dark gray containers make currency displays more prominent and clearly clickable
4. **Improved Button Layout**: Outcome page buttons are now properly spaced, taller, and match the gacha buy page style
5. **Inline Costs**: Cost display is integrated into the button itself, creating a cleaner layout

## Testing Notes

All changes have been implemented and the application should run without errors. The UI improvements are visible on:
- Inventory page (tile count/name changes)
- Gacha buy page (currency container)
- Outcome page (currency container, button layout, cost display)

## Files Modified

1. `src/ui/pokemon_tile.py` - Count label size, name padding
2. `src/states/gacha_outcome_state.py` - Currency container, button redesign
3. `src/states/gacha_buy_state.py` - Currency container, click handler

All changes maintain consistency with existing code style and architecture.
